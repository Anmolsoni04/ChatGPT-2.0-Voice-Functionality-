# ChatGPT-2.0-Voice-Functionality-
I've developed a new version of ChatGpt in which user can login and ask their queries by typing in a text and by voice method. In this version of chatGPT, user can speak their queries by tapping the mic and results will appear accordingly. Tech stacks i used: Django, Tailwind CSS, Django templating, OpenAI, Python.
